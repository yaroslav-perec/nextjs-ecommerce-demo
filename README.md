# 🛍️ Next.js E-commerce Demo

A modern, responsive e-commerce web app built with **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and **Zustand**, using the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com) as a mock backend.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, modular structure, and persistent cart logic suitable for modern React applications.

## 💡 Thought Process & Trade-offs

* **🧠 State management:**
  Used **Zustand** instead of Redux for a simpler and more lightweight solution that fits perfectly for a small-scale e-commerce demo.

* **💾 Persistence:**
  Used `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage` to mimic a guest session that resets when the browser closes.

* **📡 Data fetching:**
  API requests are made via server components using native `fetch` with `{ cache: 'no-store' }` to ensure fresh data on every request.

* **🎨 Styling:**
  Tailwind CSS v4 was used for rapid iteration and built-in dark mode support.

* **🧱 Architecture:**
  Each feature (home, cart, products, shared) is isolated in its own `/modules` folder for scalability.

* **🧪 Testing:**
  Added **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for critical components and store logic:

    * ✅ `useCart` store — state persistence & quantity logic
    * ✅ `AddToCartButton` — interaction and UI behavior
    * ✅ `HomePage` — render sanity test

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* No backend checkout or authentication — this is a **frontend-only demo**.
* Product API (DummyJSON) has static mock data.
* SEO and Open Graph metadata are simplified for the demo.
* Limited test coverage — only core logic and render tests implemented.

---

## 🧠 Possible Extensions

* 🔍 Product search and filtering
* 💳 Checkout mockup
* ⭐ Product rating and reviews
* 🌐 i18n / multi-language support
* 🧾 E2E testing with Playwright
